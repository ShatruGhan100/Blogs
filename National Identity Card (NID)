🚨 Imagine you wake up at morning and find your bank account frozen with your all money gone and someone else is stealing in your name. You rush to get help, but government offices deny you access to healthcare, pensions, or even your driver’s license, claiming your records don’t match. Shops and offices refuse your ID, and you’re left struggling to prove who you are.

Meanwhile, criminals take out loans and buy things using your identity, while banks scramble helplessly. Government systems are in chaos, tax refunds delayed, emergency aid stalled, and vital services disrupted. At the highest level, voter records are tampered with elections stall and officials scramble to verify who’s who. National security hangs by a thread as sensitive data is stolen and falsified. Millions face the same nightmare with no money, no ID, no help.

You Are Exposed!! 😱🔐
A Reality Check on Nepal’s National ID System and Cybersecurity.

Ever wondered what would happen if your fingerprints, eye scan, and personal data fell into the wrong hands?

Nepal’s National Identity Card (NID) is being rolled out rapidly and mandatory for government services. It’s chip-based, collects biometric + personal info and is supposed to make our lives easier.

But behind this shiny digital progress lies a question:

“Is our data actually safe?”

🤔 What’s Stored in the NID?
Full name, DOB, address, photo
Fingerprints, iris scan, and digital signature
Citizenship, family info
All stored in centralized servers + smart card chip
This is basically your digital soul.

🛡️ Security Measures (The Good News)
Nepal has implemented some solid defenses according to the government:

✅ Biometric Encryption — Your fingerprints & iris data are encrypted in both the chip and backend servers.

✅ Role-Based Access Control — Only authorized personnel can access your info.

✅ Firewalls & Backups — Systems are shielded with firewalls and backups are regularly made.

✅ Physical Security — Data centers have CCTV, guard checks, and restricted entry.

✅ Legal Shields — Privacy Act 2075, proposed Data Protection Bill.

✅ International Standards — Based on ICAO & ISO/IEC frameworks.

✅ Backups: Data is regularly backed up (hopefully somewhere safe)

But…

😬 Here Comes the Plot Twist
Despite the armor, the enemy keeps slipping in. Why?

Major Challenges:
❌ No independent data protection authority
❌ Weak enforcement of cybersecurity laws
❌ Government websites still get hacked regularly
❌ Low public digital literacy — easy victims of phishing & fraud
❌ Frequent data leaks — little to no action
❌ Only 20 technical staff in Cyber Bureau (out of 84!)
❌ Over 19,000 cybercrime complaints last year, but less than 1% go to court
It’s like building a digital fortress but leaving the back door open… and hoping no one notices 😅

📉 A National Wake-Up Call
Nepal ranks 94th globally in the cybersecurity index. Till now in 2025, over 400 government websites in Nepal were already affected by cyberattacks. Additionally, 21+ official subdomains under Koshi Province were defaced.

Cybercrime has gone from 237 cases (2075 B.S.) to over 19,700+ in 2081/82 and only about 200 complaints were actually taken to court by the police. This amounts to less than one percent of total cases, indicating systemic weaknesses in investigation and prosecution. Most of these involve password hacking, fake identities, deepfakes, and financial thefts.

Our Cyber Bureau is understaffed, underfunded, and struggling to even respond to personal email hacks and let alone national cyber threats.

Some recent incident happens in Nepal:
🔓 Nepal Police Database Breach — April 22, 2025
A Hacker group “Kazu” leaks personal details of over 2 million citizens, including citizenship, passport, and police documents by gaining unauthorized access to the police database, likely through weak endpoint security and lack of multi-layered authentication.

In additional, hacker group “Kazu” apparently breached the Nepal Tuberculosis Patient Registry Portal, offering to sell a dataset of ~159,000 patient records, including medical histories, HIV status, and contact information.

⚠️ Hello Sarkar Portal Breach — March 26, 2025
A Russian hacker group “Ghudra” access a full database (~100,000 rows) of PII including names, emails, phone numbers, passwords, office IDs, addresses, and more by SQL injection combined with poor access control mechanisms then offered “live shell access” to compromised servers for USD 1,300.

🌐 Koshi Province Government Defacement — February 13, 2025
A Hacker group “YNR” defaced 21 provincial government websites by exposed DNS vulnerabilities and exploited misconfigured DNS and outdated CMS platforms.

📡 Hacktivist Nepal Campaign — April 2025 (Multiple Dates)
Team IT Soldiers Nepal (domestic pro-monarchy group) called Hacktivist Nepal defaced Website of DishHome, Education Department, and Transport Management portals by Cross-site scripting (XSS) and admin panel brute-force techniques, targeting weak credentials and outdated software.

🕶️ Midnight Ops Nepal Campaign — June 2025
A collaborative hackers group “NEPALxROOT, M0NG00SE” defaced multiple websites including Chitwan Medical College, Nepal Open University, Department of Hydrology & Meteorology and private portals by Remote file inclusion (RFI) and unauthorized shell access after bypassing web application firewalls (WAF).

⚠️ Key Takeaways
Sensitive Data is not safe: From police records to medical data, even core institutions have failed to prevent major leaks.
Attackers are getting bolder: Hacktivists, data merchants and ideological groups are using Nepal as a testbed.
No breach disclosure laws: Most agencies never admit breaches or notify affected users.
The private sector is also at risk: ISPs, colleges, and hospitals are soft targets due to poor IT budgets and weak governance.
🧠 What needs to be done
✅ Create an independent data protection authority

✅ Regular audits & public breach disclosures

✅ Train & equip police, army, & govt staff in real cyber forensics

✅ Enforce mandatory cybersecurity awareness twice a year

✅ Update the Electronic Transaction Act into a modern Cybercrime Law

✅ Make cybersecurity education mandatory in schools & universities

✅ Encourage public-private partnerships for a national cyber defense force

✅ Engage regionally via SAARC/UN for international threat sharing

✅ Interaction and discussion session with cybersecurity professionals

🌐 Why It Matters
Nepal had 15.4 million internet users in 2024. Digital adoption is rising.

But with that comes phishing, fake apps, ransomware, cyberbullying, scams, and spying.

And sadly, AI-powered attacks are already knocking on our door.

🔒In Closing
The politicians of our Nepal are seeking for their positions, powers and many are planning for corruptions. Authorities and departments are busy in fulfilling the personal needs of politicians. Some are trying but without the proper facilities and infrastructures. We, the citizens of Nepal are busy for the Democracy and Monarchy Movement in Nepal. Due to this, Digital Safety has become the child of many mothers — claimed by all, raised by none.

Nepal is going digital, but without the right locks on our digital doors. Our data, our identity, is a national asset. Nepal must urgently modernize its cybersecurity strategy, strengthen laws and institutions, develop skilled professionals, and pursue regional and global cooperation to tackle increasing cyberthreats and safeguard its digital future.

Let’s raise our voices for stronger cybersecurity, transparency, modern laws, better tools, real legal protections, and a future where our national ID doesn’t turn into a national vulnerability.

✍️ If you’re reading this, you are part of the solution. Don’t hope and rely completely on government for the safety. Let’s start to aware other peoples and ensure personal data safety by yourself as possible. Share this. Start the conversation. Demand digital safety.
